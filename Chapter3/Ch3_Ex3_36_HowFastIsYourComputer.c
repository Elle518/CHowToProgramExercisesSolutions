       Program: Ch3_Ex3_36_HowFastIsYourComputer.c
   Descripci√≥n: This program uses a while loop that counts from 1 to
                1,000,000,000 by 1s. Every time the count reaches a multiple of
                100,000,000, prints that number on the screen. Use your watch
                to time how long each 100 million iterations of the loop takes.
