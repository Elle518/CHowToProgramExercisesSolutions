/*
       Program: Ch3_Ex3_44_SidesOfRightTriangle.c
   Descripci√≥n: This program reads three nonzero integers and determines and
                prints whether they could be the sides of a right triangle. The
                Pythagorean theorem states that:

                  c^2 = a^2 + b^2
                
                where c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the
                right angle), and a and b are the lengths of the remaining two
                sides.
