/*
       Program: Ch3_Ex3_43_SidesOfTriangle.c
   DescripciÃ³n: This program reads three nonzero integer values and determines
                and prints whether they could represent the sides of a triangle.
                The triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of
                the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of
                the remaining side.

                  a + b > c
                  b + c > a
                  c + a > b
