       Program: Ch4_Ex4_9_SumSequenceOfIntegers.c
   Descripci√≥n: This program sums a sequence of integers. Assume that the first
                integer read with scanf specifies the number of values remaining
                to be entered. The program reads only one value each time scanf
                is executed.
