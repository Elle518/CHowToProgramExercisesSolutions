       Program: Ch2_Ex2_19_ArithmeticLargestSmallest.c
   Descripci√≥n: This program inputs three different integers from the keyboard,
                then prints the sum, the average, the product, the smallest and
                the largest of these numbers. Use only the single-selection form
                of the if statement. The screen dialogue should appear as follows:

			       	Enter three different integers: 13 27 14
			       	Sum is 54
			       	Average is 18
			       	Product is 4914
			       	Smallest is 13
			       	Largest is 27
