/*
       Program: Ch5_Ex5_39_RecursiveGreatestCommonDivisor.c
   Descripci√≥n: This program uses a recursive function that returns the greatest
                common divisor of x and y. The gcd of x and y is defined
                recursively as follows: If y is equal to 0, then gcd(x, y) is x;
                otherwise gcd(x, y) is gcd(y, x % y), where % is the remainder
                operator.
